For the most accurate result, please notice the following instructions:
- Take a top-view picture of your foot putting on an A4 paper
    1. The paper should be white, flat and ALL OF THE 4 CONNERS ARE VISIBLE
    2. Your heel is expected to touch the width of the paper, and the 2 sides are almost parallel to the 2 long edges
    3. It is best if your background is homogeneous (in plain color OTHER THAN WHITE and without any clutered structures)
    4. It is recommended that your cammera is placed parrallely to the ground, within a range of about 0.5 meters
    5. We can measure only one foot at a time.
